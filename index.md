<h3 >Where to get Indian Clothes</h3>
<p> For our Global friends, if you'd like to get Indian clothes, here is a short list of brands & stores. <br> For the more casual events you'd be looking for kurtas, simple sarees, or simple lehengas. For the formal event you'd be looking for more elaborate sarees and lehengas or bandhgala, sherwanis styles.  </p>

<h3 >Where to get vaccines for India in NYC</h3>
<p>
One of our friends had a very good experience with the <a href="https://www.travelhealth.net/">New York Center for Travel and Tropical Medicine</a> and would happily recommend them. Our friend said: 

"the place does a little consult, talks about travel, then offers vax recommendations.

two reasons it is good are: all prices are posted in full on their website (not true for places like Passport Health!) + they didn't push things that I didn't think I need + they suggested my partner just go to a pharmacy to get her TDAP vax instead of paying for it there lol"
