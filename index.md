## Wedding Details For Friends

Hello\! Here is some info for our upcoming NUPTIALS. This document will continue to be updated.

The “formal events” are  on 7/3 & 7/4, with additional casual hangs all weekend. See schedule below.

## Events
We’ll be hanging around all weekend and dream of spontaneous hangs and get togethers. We’re dreaming of a saturday (7/5) picnic with whoever is still around. Maybe a trip to a brewery, who knows\! We imagine a world where folks are proposing and arranging their own events or explorations. The Bay 🌁 has so much to offer 💜.

## Books As Gifts 📖

Everyone does love gifts. Here is what we’d *love* from you.

Pick 1 book that has either:

* Taught you something about being a good person, or
* Taught you something about leading a good life.

Include notes on why you picked what you did.

Bring TWO copies.

One will find a new home on K\&M’s wedding book shelf and the other will go into
a swap pile at our Sangeet. You’ll get to go home with a book 💜.

## FAQs

Text us and we’ll add to this section.

#### Do I have to come to every event?

No. But tell us if you’re coming to the wedding so we have your headcount for the caterer.

#### What if I want to give you guys a non-book gift, do you have a registry?

Thank you, you dreamy person. We have no registry. If you are so moved, you could donate to of these two organizations in our names:
