## RSVP!

Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/gkEnJbgXrAirQJyK9) to tell us
which events you're coming to and what you're doing for Sangeet!

## Events

The "formal events" are on 7/3 & 7/4. Outside those we'll be hanging around all
weekend and dream of spontaneous hangs and get-togethers. There will be a casual
picnic on Saturday (7/5) with whoever is still around and wants to come.

### 👰🏾‍♀️🤵🏾‍♂️<br/>Wedding
###### **7/3/2025**
###### _4:30pm – 10:45pm_
###### [Temescal Beach House](https://www.ebparks.org/reservations/event-venues/beach-house), Oakland, CA

<br/>

The wedding will run from mid-afternoon into the evening, with dinner and cake
provided. Check [the
weather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/berkeley/94704/daily-weather-forecast/332044)!
It can go from quite hot during the day to cool at night. We recommend lighter
clothing and bringing a jacket. The venue has both indoor and outdoor parts and
we'll move between them.

##### What to bring
2 copies of a book! See "Books as Gifts 📖" below.

##### When to arrive

Aim to arrive around 4.30pm. The Baraat -- a walk around the lake leaves at 5pm.

##### How to get there

You can drive or Uber.

##### Where to park

The venue has a dedicated parking lot that fits about 15 cars
([link](https://www.ebparks.org/reservations/event-venues/beach-house)), and
there's also an overflow parking lot that's shared with the public.

##### Event schedule

##### Vibe

Summery, floral, cocktail  party vibes.

##### Dress suggestion

|   |   |
| :----: | :---- |
| <span style="font-size: 2em;">🇮🇳</span> | - Indian kurta pajama <br/> - Salwar Kameez <br/> - Lehenga |
| <span style="font-size: 2em;">🇺🇸</span> | - A suit <br/> - Collared shirt & pants <br/> - Dress |

##### What is a Baraat?

My own experience of Baraats is this. The groom gets on a horse, or perhaps a
chariot or an elephant if his father is rich. He is joined on his mount by a
small child. Around the horse, on the ground, is a very loud brass band in
uniform. Right behind are all his friends and family, dancing. The whole
procession goes on the street. Cars honk, motorcycles swerve, the group moves
slowly forward, continually dancing and singing, all accompanied by the band.
They enter the wedding venue and are met by the girl's family. Then: greetings
given, garlands exchanged, snacks served.

Ours will be the same but with no horse, no chariot, no elephant, no band, no
dancing, no street, no cars, and no motorcycles.

### 🎭<br/>Sangeet
###### _aka Show and Tell, or, a Friend Talent Show_
###### **7/4/2025**
###### _6:00 pm \- 10:00 pm_
###### [Live Oak Community Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xYpbKukNdbr5NUtE6?g_st=ipc), Berkeley, CA

#### Sangeet FAQ
##### What is a Sangeet?

A Sangeet (_Sung Together_ from Sanskrit) traditionally occurs before the
wedding and is a time for friends and family to join together for song and
dance. We're adapting it to be a Show and Tell on the theme of Love, Change and
Leaps of Faith.

##### Who is the talent?
You. You are the talent.

##### What are examples of things people are doing?

- The groom will share his Apple Notes (48 and growing) about the bride.
- A close friend will sing a song on guitar about remembering loved ones who
  have passed.
- The bride and groom will demonstrate their commitment to *carrying* each other
  through hard times.
- There will be a game that pits the bride's friends against the groom's.
- Our friend Nolen (hi!) will juggle. Well we haven't asked him yet but we hope
  he will perform this Leap of Faith with gravity.

##### When to arrive
We'll start the show at 6:30pm and eat around 7pm.

##### How to get there
If you're in East Bay or San Francisco, you can Uber directly or you can take
BART to Downtown Berkeley. From there take the 18 or 67 bus, or Uber. Keep in
mind it will be July 4!

##### Where to park
Live Oak Community Center does not have onsite parking, so you will need to find
street parking if you're driving.

##### What to bring
Whatever you need for your show and tell!

##### Food
We'll provide a casual dinner (probably pizza) and nonalcoholic beverages (the venue is alcohol free).

##### Vibe
Dressy casual.

### 🧺☀️🍷<br/>Picnic (Casual)
###### **7/5/2025**
###### 11:00 am \- 3:00 pm
###### [Cragmont Rock Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AuwZqEi6EHYFj8p8A), Berkeley, CA

##### How to get there
We recommend taking an Uber from the Downtown Berkeley BART station or carpool.

##### Food
We will provide pastries & coffee, bring any other treats you want to share.

##### Vibe
Casual.

##### Dress suggestion

Literally anything.

## Travel & Accommodations

##### Flying
The closest airports are SFO and OAK. You can take the BART to Berkeley from either.

##### Getting around
It's easy to get around with Uber and BART, so you don't need to rent a car unless you really want to.

##### Lodging
We recommend you get an AirBnb. If you're worried about finding a place to stay, hit us up and we'll find a way to house you\!

##### Map

Here's a map with:
* locations where the events are happening
* M's favorite restaurants, and
* where we think it would be good to get an AirBnb (the purple regions)

## Books As Gifts 📖

Everyone loves gifts. Here is what we'd *love* from you.

Bring TWO copies of ONE book that has either:

* Taught you something about being a good person, or
* Taught you something about leading a good life.

Include a note or inscription inside both copies of the book explaining why you
picked it.

One copy will find a new home on K\&M's wedding book shelf and the other will go
into a swap pile at our Wedding. You'll get to go home with a book 💜.

## FAQs

More Qs? Text us and we'll add to this section.

#### Can my kids come?

Yes! Children are welcome! Mother Nature put the wiggle in children, so don't
feel like you have to suppress it at our event.

#### Do I have to come to every event?

No. But please [RSVP](https://forms.gle/gkEnJbgXrAirQJyK9) (especially to the wedding) so we have enough food for everyone!

#### What about the India wedding?

There will be one! Probably in Jan or Feb 2026. We're figuring out the details and will reach out soon.

#### What if I want to give you guys a non-book gift? Do you have a registry?

Thank you, you dreamy person. We have no registry. If you are so moved, you
could donate to one of these two organizations in our names. Drop us a note if
you decide to do that!

| Charity | Why we picked it |
| :---- | :---- |
| [Malaria Consortium (click to donate)](https://www.malariaconsortium.org/support-us/donate.htm) | They are [GiveWell's top charity](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) because they are cost-effective and give rigorous evidence that the programs they run actually work. |
| [World Central Kitchen (click to donate)](https://wck.org/donate) | [Charity Navigator awards them four stars](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/273521132) for their work providing food to people struck by disaster, in places including Gaza, Ukraine and Southern California. |
